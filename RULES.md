The Horde (app) and the Survivors (you).

## Rules

### Horde

 * The Horde has infinite mana
 * The Horde has no hand, each cards draw must be cast
 * The Horde can't gains life
 * The Horde doesn't blocks
 * The Horde life is equal to the number of cards in his library + cards it controls onto the battlefield
 * Any decisions the horde has to make are random
 * All creatures controlled by the Horde have haste and "This creature must attack each turn if able"
 * If the Horde loses X life or discards X cards then X cards are removed from his top library
 
###  Survivors 
 
* The Survivors take their turn simultaneously, and attack and block as a team, like in the Two Headed Giant format
* The Survivors are a group of one or more players, who can use any pre-built deck of their choosing.
* The Survivors have a shared life total, which starts at 20 for each player (eg: 1 player = 20 life, 2 players = 40 life, etc)
